Concretely, json file contain :
- Beacons (id,position)
- Nodes (position,neighbours)
- Constants (speed and acceleration limits)
- Legs (start and end nodes)
- Waypoints (type, position)

## jsonApi.c/.h
In order to import json information to the robot, jsonApi.c contain main functions manipulate this information and convert them to C structures wich can be used by the main program of the robot.
